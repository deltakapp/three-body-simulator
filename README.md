## Three Body Simulator

This is a simulation of the three body problem in typescript, HTML, and CSS

## What is the Three-body Problem

The three body problem is a problem in physics involving the interactions of three bodies in motion whose movements depend on the positions and masses of their peers in the system. Because no general closed-form solution exists for this problem, it must be simulated analytically, as this project does. For more information, read [Three-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem)
